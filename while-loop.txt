------> THE WHILE LOOP::: 

WE WILL HAVE THE SAME COMPONENTS: THE STARTING COUNTER, THE CONDITION, AND THE INCREASE OR DECREASE: 

- BUT THE WHILE LOOP IS MORE VERSATILE THAN THE FOR LOOP

IMP:: BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY NEED A COUNTER!!!!

ALL THE WHILE LOOP REALLY NEEDS IS THE CONDITION!!!!!!!

WHICH NEEDS TO STAY TRUE FOR IT TO KEEP RUNNING

- AND THAT CONDITION CAN BE ANY CONDITION!! 

- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RELATED TO ANY COUNTER AT ALL AND SOMETIMES THAT'S EXACTILY
WHAT WE NEED TO SOLVE A CERTAIN PROBLEM - A PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY COUNTER, WITHOUT A NUMBER THAT IS INCREASING 

- WE USE WHILE WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW BEFOREHAN HOW MANY ITERATIONS THE LOOP WILL HAVE

let dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6) + 1;

while (dice !== 6){
    console.log(`You rolled a ${dice}`);
    dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    if (dice === 6) console.log('Loop is about to end...');
}
