------- ACTIVATING STRICT MODE:

// strict mode is a special mode that we can activate in JS which makes easier for us to write a secure JS code
// and all we have to do to write a secure code is to write this string at the beginning of the script 
// the first line of code should be the string 'use strict' - NO CODE - COMMENTS ARE ALLOWED -
// we can also actually activate the strict mode ONLY FOR A SPECIFIC FUNCTION OR A SPECIFIC BLOCK 
// BUT JUST ALWAYS PUT THE STRICT MODE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR SCRIPTS AND LIKE THAT WRITE MORE SECURE CODE 

// WHAT SECURE CODE MEANS? MEANS THAT IT MAKES EASIER FOR US DEVELOPERS TO AVOID ACCIDENTAL ERRORS. 
// SO BASICALLY IT AVOIDS US INTRODUCE BUGS INTO OUR CODE BECAUSE OF 2 REASONS 
// FIRST, STRICT MODE FORBIDS US TO DO CERTAIN THINGS 
// AND SECOND, IT WILL ACTUALLY CREATE VISIBLE ERRORS FOR US IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS IN WHICH WITHOUT THE STRICT MODE JS WOULD SIMPLY FAIL SILENTLY 
// WITHOUT LETTING US KNOW THAT WE DID A MISTAKE 
// another thing strict mode does is to introduce a short list of variable names that are reserved for features that might be added to the language a bit latter
