----> THE CONDITIONAL (TERNARY) OPERATOR 

We already saw two ways of writing conditionals:

a) the regular if-else statement and
b) the switch statement

BUT THERE IS ANOTHER ONE, and that's the conditional operator.

So the conditional operator allows us to write something similar to an if-else statement BUT ALL IN ONE LINE 

EX: 

const age = 23;

age >= 18 ? console.log('I like to drink wine') : console.log('I like to drink water');

obs the else block goes after : 

- The conditional operator is in fact an operator so 
REMEMBER THAT AN OPERATOR ALWAYS PRODUCE A VALUE
