- different ways of declaring variables:

- Let and const were introduced in ES6 and so they are modern JS 
While the VAR keyword is the old way of declaring variables 

---- > WE USE THE LET KEYWORD TO DECLARE VARIABLES THAT CAN CHANGE LATER!!!!!! 
WHEN WE WANT TO MUTATE A VARIABLE IT`S THE PERFECT CASE TO USE LET 
AND THAT ALSO COUNTS FOR THE CASE THAT WE WANT TO DECLARE EMPTY VARIABLES 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----- > IN THE OTHER HAND, WE USE THE CONST KEYWORD TO DECLARE VARIABLES THAT 
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CHANGE AT ANY POINT IN THE FUTURE 

- SO THE VALUE IN A CONST VARIABLE CANNOT BE CHANGED - IMMUTABLE VARIABLE
- IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE CANNOT DECLARE EMPTY VARIABLES WITH CONST 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----> THE VAR KEYWORD:

- should be completely avoided 

- is basically the old way of defining a variable prior to ES6 

- at first sight, it works pretty much the same as let
