- STRINGS AND TEMPLATE LITERALS 

- build strings using something called template literals 

const firstName = 'Jonas';
const job = 'Teacher';

const birthYear = 1991; 
const year = 2037;

const jonas = "I'm " + firstName + ', a' + (year - birthYear) 

- JavaScript will convert the number (age) to a string so THAT IT CAN
CONCATENATE THEM, SO IT CAN JOIN IT WITH THE REST OF THE STRINGS

---- WITH ES6 IT`S EASIER TO DO THIS KIND OF THING - IT`S CALLED TEMPLATE LITERALS 

- WITH TEMPLATE LITERALS WE CAN WRITE A STRING IN A MORE NORMAL WAY, AND THEN BASICALLY 
INSERT THE VARIABLES DIRECTLY INTO THE STRING THEN THEY WILL SIMPLY BE REPLACED 

- A TEMPLATE LITERAL CAN ASSEMBLE MULTIPLE PIECES INTO ONE FINAL STRING 

- TEMPLATE LITERALS CAN ALSO BE USED TO CREATE MULTILINE STRINGS
