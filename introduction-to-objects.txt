IT'S ANOTHER DATA STRUCTURE 

IN ARRAYS WE CAN'T REFERENCE EACH OF THE ELEMENTS BY THE NAME BUT ONLY BY THEIR
ORDER NUMBER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR IN THE ARRAY.

TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE HAVE ANOTHER DATA STRUCTURE IN JS CALLED OBJECTS
SO IN OBJECTS, WE ACTUALLY DEFINE KEY VALUE PAIRS

- CREATING AN OBJECT:

const jonas = {
    firstName: 'Jonas',
    lastName: 'blablabla',
    age: 2037 - 1991,
    job: 'teacher',
    friends: ['Michael', 'Peter', 'Steven']
}

IMP: EACH OF THESE KEYS IS ALSO CALLED A PROPERTY

- that was the literal syntax of creating an OBJECT

-----> HOW DO WE GET DATA FROM AN OBJECT:

DOT VS BRACKET SYNTAX: 

THE ORDEROF THE PROPERTIES SIMPLY JUST NOT MATTER
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE SIMPLY GET THE PROPERTIES FROM THE OBJECT USING THE PROPERTY NAME ITSELF 

1- SO THE FIRST WAY FROM GETTING A PROPERTY FROM AN OBJECT IS USING THE DOT NOTATION 
console.log(jonas.lastName);

2- WITH THE BRACKET NOTATION: 
console.log(jonas['lastName']);

IMP::::: WE CAN USE ANY EXPRESSION WITH THE [], FOR EX:

const nameKey = 'Name';
console.log(jonas['first' + nameKey]);
console.log(jonas['last' + name]); 

-------------> ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF THE [] TO ACESS PROPERTIES:

const interestedIn = prompt('What do you want to know about jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job and friends');

console.log(jonas[interestedIn]);


OBS: THE PROMPT BUILT IN FUNCTION WILL RETURN A STRING THAT WE CAN STORE INTO A VARIABLE!!!!!
WITH THIS AND WITH THE [] SYNTAX WE CAN CREATE A FUNCTION THAT CAN ASSOCIATE THE PROMPT RETURN STRING WITH THE OBJECT PROPERTIES

----- IT WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED WITH THE DOT SYNTAX, BECAUSE IT IS LITERAL RELATED TO THE OBJECT PROPERTIES, 
SO THE OUTPUT WILL BE UNDEFINED IF jonas.interestedIn, since theres no interestedIn as property

-------- > IMP::: UNDEFINED IS A FALSY VALUE!!!!!!! 

if(jonas[interestedIn]){
   console.log(jonas[interestedIn]);
}  else{
    console.log('Wrong request! Choose between firstName, lastName, age, job and friends');')
}

----------> ADDING PROPERTIES USING THE DOT AND THE []::

jonas.location = 'Portugal;'
jonas['location'] = 'Portugal';
