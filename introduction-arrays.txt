--- DATA ESTRUCTION: ARRAY

ex: store friend's names into variables so I can use them later

An array is like a big container into which we can throw variables and then
later reference them 

the 2 most important data estructure, at least in JS are Arrays and Objects 

const friend1 = 'Michael';
const friend2 = 'Steven';
const friend3 = 'Peter'; 

const friends = ['Michael', 'Steven', 'Peter'];
const years = new Array(1991, 1984, 2008, 2020);

to see the number of elements of the array we use:

console.log(friends.length);
console.log(friends[friends.length -1]); - // TO SEE THE VERY LAST ITEM OF THE ARRAY

AN EXPRESSION CAN BE USED INSIDE THE [] 
AN EXPRESSION IS SOMETHING THAT PRODUCES A VALUE 

- WE COULD NOT PUT A STATEMENT INSIDE THE []
