--------- > FUNCTIONS 

The fundamental building block of real world JS applications are functions.

They are one of the most essential concepts in the language 

- SO WHAT ACTUALLY ARE FUNCTIONS? 
    IN THE MOST SIMPLE FORM A FUNCTION IS SIMPLY A PIECE OF CODE TAHT WE CAN REUSE OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN OUR CODE.
    So it's a little bit like a variable but for whole chunks of code.
    So remember, a variable holds value BUT A FUNCTION CAN HOLD ONE OR MORE COMPLETE LINES OF CODE  


----> CREATING A FUNCTION : 

function logger() {
    console.log('My name is Larissa');
}

CALLING/ RUNNING / INVOKING THE FUNCTION: 

logger();

--- USUALLY, WHEN WE WRITE A FUNCTION WE ALSO PASS DATA INTO A FUNCTION 
AND ADDITIONALLY, A FUNCTION CAN ALSO RETURN DATA AS WELL, WHICH MEANS TO GIVE US DATA BACK THAT WE CAN THEN USE FOR SOMETHING
ELSE IN THE PROGRAM 

SO A FUNCTION CANNOT ONLY REUSE A PIECE OF CODE LIKE THE FUNCTION LOGGER 
BUT IT CAN ALSO RECEIVE DATA AND RETURN DATA BACK. 

IMAGINE A FUNCTION LIKE A FOOD PROCESSOR 
WE CAN ALSO SPECIFY SOMETHING CALLED PARAMETERS 

AND PARAMETERS ARE LIKE VARIABLES THAT ARE SPECIFIC ONLY TO THIS FUNCTION 
AND THEY WILL GET DEFINED ONCE WE CALL THE FUNCTION

function foodProcessor(apples, oranges) { 

}

and again these two parameters WILL GET DEFINED ONCE THE FUNCTION IS CALLED!!!
AND THEY REPRESENT THE INPUT DATA OF THIS FUNCTION!!
