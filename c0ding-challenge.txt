1- F0r each 0f them, create an 0bject with PROPERTIES FOR THEIR FULL NAME, MASS AND HEIGHT (MARK MILLER AND JOHN SMITH);

2- CREATE A 'calcBMI' METHOD ON EACH OBJECT TO CALCULATE THE BMI (THE SAME METHOD FOR BOTH OBJECTS). 
STORE THE BMI VALUE TO A PROPERTY, AND ALSO RETURN IT FROM THE METHOD. 

3- LOG TO THE CONSOLE WHO HAS THE HIGHER BMI, TOGETHER WITH THE FuLL NAME NAME AND THE RESPECTIVE BMI, 
EXAMPLE: 'JOHN'S BMI (28.3) IS HIGHER THAN MARK'S (23.9)!' 

TEST DATA: MARK WEIGHTS 78 KG AND IS 1,69 M TALL. 
JOHN WEIGHTS 92 KG AND IS 1.95 M TALL 

OBS::: HOW TO CALCULATE -> BMI = MASS / HEIGHT ** 2 = MASS / (HEIGHT ** HEIGHT)

const mark {
    fullName: 'Mark Miller',
    mass: 78, 
    height: 1.69, 
    calcBmi: function(){
        this.bmi = this.mass / (this.height * this.height);
        return this.bmi;

    }
};


const john {
    fullName: 'John Smith',
    mass: 92, 
    height: 1.95, 
    calcBmi: function(){
        this.bmi = this.mass / (this.height * this.height);
        return this.bmi;
    }
};


------ OBS::: THE FUNCION HAS NO PARAMETERS BECAUSE WE WILL TAKE THE DATA DIRECTLY FROM THE OBJECT
