------>  A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO JS 

JavaScript is a high level object-oriented, multi paradigm programming language


- Programming language = INSTRUCT COMPUTER TO DO THINGS 

- High Level Language = we dont need to worry about complex stuff like memory management 

- Objecte oriented = Based on objects for storing most kinds of data 

- Multi Paradigm = We can use different styles of programming - SUCH AS DECLARATIVE AND IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING


---- DIFERENCA : DECLARATIVE LANGUAGE X IMPERATIVE LANGUAGE 

ABORDAGEM IMPERATIVA : VOCE IRA DESCREVER "COMO" VOCE FAZ ALGUMA COISA 

ex: function double(arr) {
	let results = []
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		results.push(arr[i] * 2)
	}
	return results
}

ABORDAGEM DECLARATIVA : VOCE IRA DESCREVER "O QUE" VOCE FAZ 

const double = arr => arr.map((item) => item * 2)



---> THE ROLE OF JS IN WEB DEVELOPMENT:

-- 3 CORE TECHNOLOGIES OF THE WEB: 

A) HTML: responsable for the content of the page, such as text, buttons, imagens 


B) CSS : presentation of the HTML`S content 


C) JS : The real programming language of the internet. And it allows developers to add dynamic and interactive effects to 
any webpage
        We also use it to manipulate the content or the CSS, load data from remove servers, and 
        really build intire applications in the browser, which we then call web applications   


- WE CAN ALSO USE THIS ANALOGY 

- HTML = NOUNS 
- CSS = ADJETIVES 
- JS = VERBS 

---- IMPPPPP :::::: THE JS LANGUAGE AND THE WEB BROWSER ARE ACTUALLY TWO SEPARATE THINGS 

 AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT JS CAN ALSO RUN OUTSIDE OF WEB BROWSERS - 
 for example: IT`S POSSIBLE TO USE JavaScript ON A WEB SERVER USING A VERY POPULAR TECHNOLOGY CALLED NODE.JS 
 WHICH DOESN`T NEED ANY BROWSER AT ALL 

--- WHEN WE CREATE JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER WE CREATE SO CALLED FRONT END APPLICATIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!
