--------> OPERATOR PRECEDENCE:

- PRECEDENCE OF DIFFERENT OPERATORS 

const now = 2037;
const ageJonas = now - 1991;
const ageSarah = now - 2018; 

console.log(now - 1991 > now - 2018); - WHY DOES THIS WORK?

why js first calculates de - operation before the comparisson?

- IT WORKS THIS WAY BECAUSE JS HAS A WELL DEFINED ORDER OF OPERATOR PRECEDENCE(THE ORDER IN WHICH OPERATOR ARE EXECUTED)
