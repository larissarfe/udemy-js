----> FUNCTIONS DECLARATIONS VC FUNCTIONS EXPRESSIONS 

IN JS THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF WRITING FUNTIONS.
AND EACH TYPE OF FUNCTION WORKS IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY 

THE LOGGER FUNCTION AND THE foodProcessor FUNCTION ARE CALLED FUNTION DECLARATIONS 
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY USE THE FUNCTION KEYWORD TO DECLARE A FUNCTION A BIT LIKE WE DECLARE A VARIABLE 

IMP:::: TO TAKE THE VALUE OUT OF THE FUNCTION WE RETURN IT USING THE RETURN KEYWORD  


- LET'S WRITE ANOTHER FUNCTION DECLARATION :  

function calcAge1(birthYear){
    return 2037 - birthYear;
}

RETURNED A VALUE 

const age1 = calcAge1(1991);
console.log(age1); 


------- FUNCTION EXPRESSION: or anonymous function 

- IT'S BASICALLY AN EXPRESSION AND AN EXPRESSION PRODUCES A VALUE 

const calcAge2 = function (birthYear){
    return 2037 - birthYear;
}

STORE THE NAMELESS FUNCTION INTO A VARIABLE AND THEN THE VARIABLE WILL BE THE FUNCTION 

const age2 = calcAge2(1991);
console.log(calcAge2);

THE FUNCTION DECLARATION AND FUNCTION EXPRESSION WORK IN THE EXACTLY SAME WAY 
WE CALL IT IN THE SAME WAY, WE CAPTURE THE RETURN VALUE IN THE SAME WAY AND TE RESULT IS ALSO THE SAME 
BACAUSE THE FUNCTION BODY IS THE SAME 

IN JS FUNCTIONS ARE JUST VALUES, JUST LIKE A NUMBER OR A STRING OR A BOOLEAN VALUES 
IT'S NOT A TYPE!!!!!!!

IMP -----> THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CALL FUNCTIONS DECLARATIONS
 BEFORE THEY ARE DEFINED IN THE CODE!!!!
INTERNALLY THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE A PROCESS CALLED HOISTING
