--------> FUNCTIONS CALLING OTHER FUCTIONS 

- CALLING ONE FUNCTION FROM INSIDE ANOTHER FUNCTION: 

     this is something that we do all the time in JS 

function foodProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges`;
    return juice;
}

--> IN THIS EXAMPLE LET'S CONSIDER THAT EHR FRUIT PROCESSOR CAN ONLY MAKE JUICE WITH SMALLER FRUIT PIECES
SO BEFORE MAKING THE JUICE, THE FOOD PROCESSOR NOW NEEDS ANOTHER MACHINE THAT FIRST CUTS THE FRUITS THAT WE GIVE IT INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER PIECES 
SO::

function cutFruitPieces(fruit) {
    return fruit * 4;
}

function foodProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const applePieces = cutFruitPieces(apples);
    const orangePieces = cutFruitPieces(oranges);
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges`;
    return juice;
}
